So finally I plan to sort out the projects I worked on and the experiences I have had during these years.

Recently I have to use KNN benchmark from [this repository](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks), unfortunately the environment of some part of it can only be set up on linux. Moreover, the Linux system on my desktop PC has crashed, so I have to install Linux and set up many environments again. This leads to the idea to set up this blog for myself.

The system I'm now using is [Linux Mint 18](https://www.linuxmint.com/), which has an interface much more better than Ubuntu.
