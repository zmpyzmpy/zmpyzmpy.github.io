The OS I'm now using is [Linux Mint 18](https://www.linuxmint.com/), and I set up this environment right after the installment of the OS.
### Jekyll environment setup

First update ruby:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update ruby
```

Then install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
```bash
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

If everything is set up, then just run
```bash
$ jekyll new myblog
```
This will create a folder **myblog** which contains all the files you need to run a blog. Then chage into this new directory and run

```bash
~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Then the blog will be hosted locally on http://localhost:4000.


Some errors I encountered:

>An error occurred while installing ffi (1.9.18), and Bundler cannot
continue. Make sure that `gem install ffi -v '1.9.18'` succeeds before bundling.

In order to install ffi, first make sure you have ruby-dev and the corresponding system dependencies installed:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
```

then install ffi:

```bash
$ gem install ffi -v '1.9.18'
```


### Host on Github with custom domain
First create a repository named **username.github.io**, where **username** is the user name of the account. Then commit all the files generated by Jekyll to this repository, then you can get access to it through *http://username.github.io*.

If you want to use a custom domain, then you have to create a file named **CNAME** in the site's repository, put your domain name in this file. Add the following DNS to your domain's DNS setting.

>192.30.252.153 <br />
