## K nearest neighbors

Given a training dataset and a new instance, find the new instance's k closest instances in training set, then classify the new instance the class that majority of the k instances belong to.

More generally, given training set
$$
\begin{equation}
	T = \{ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \cdots, (x_N, y_N)\}
\end{equation}
$$

where $$x_i \in \mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathbf{R}^n$$ is the feature vector of an instance, $$y_i\in\mathcal{Y}=\{c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_K\}$$ is the class of an instance, $$i=1,2,\cdots,N$$. Input a new instance's feature vector $$x$$, output $$x$$'s class $$y$$.

1. Based on given distance measure, find $$x$$'s k nearest points in $$T$$, the region that covers these k points is denoted as $$N_k(x)$$.
2. Decide $$x$$'s class $$y$$ based on certain classification rule (such as majority vote) in $$N_k(x)$$.

This whole procedure can be abstracted as
$$
\begin{equation}
	y = \arg\max_{c_j}\sum_{x_i\in N_k(x)} I(y_i==c_i), i=1,2,\cdots,N;j=1,2,\cdots,K
\end{equation}
$$

## Distance measurement metrics

Suppose the feature space $$\mathcal{X}$$ is n dimensional real number space $$\mathbf{R}^n$$. For two vectors $$x_i, x_j\in \mathcal{X}$$, $$x_i=(x_i^{(1)},x_i^{(2)},\cdots,x_i^{(n)})^T$$, $$x_j=(x_j^{(1)},x_j^{(2)},\cdots,x_j^{(n)})^T$$. The $$L_p$$ distance between $$x_i$$ and $$x_j$$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
	L_p(x_i, x_j) = \Big(\sum_{l=1}^n |x_i^{(l)} - x_j^{(l)}|^p\Big)^{\frac{1}{p}}
\end{equation}
$$

where $$p\geq 1$$. When $$p=2$$, the distance is called Euclidean distance, defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
	L_2(x_i, x_j) = \Big(\sum_{l=1}^{n}|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}|\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
$$

When $$p=1$$, the distance is called Euclidean distance, defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
	L_1(x_i, x_j) = \sum_{l=1}^{n}|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}|
\end{equation}
$$

When $$p=\infty$$, it is the maximum distance between each coordinates, defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
	L_\infty(x_i, x_j) = \max_{l}|x_i^{(l)}-x_j^{(l)}|
\end{equation}
$$
